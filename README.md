# Movie App

This repository contains a movie app that allows users to search for movies, view movie details, and browse upcoming movies. Below are the instructions for running and testing the code, as well as a summary of the implemented features and potential improvements.

## Instructions

1. Clone this repository to your local machine.
2. Navigate to the project directory in your terminal.
3. Install the dependencies using the command: `npm install`
4. Run the development server using the command: `npm run dev`

## Implemented Features

### Efficient Initialization with Vite.js

The app has been initialized and built using Vite.js, a build tool that optimizes and reduces development and build times. This choice of technology demonstrates a commitment to modern tooling and development practices.

### API Calls and State Management

I have implemented API calls using Axios and managed the retrieved data using the Redux state library. This ensures efficient data management and separation of concerns between components and data handling.

### Search and Load More

The app allows users to search for movies based on their titles using a search input. Additionally, I have implemented an infinite scroll "Load More" feature for browsing upcoming movies, which enhances user experience and avoids the need for pagination.

## Potential Improvements

- **Theme Switcher**: Implement a theme switcher that allows users to toggle between light and dark themes. This would enhance the visual appeal of the app and demonstrate a mastery of CSS and dynamic styling.

- **Like Functionality**: Integrate the TMDB API's "like movie" feature, allowing users to like their favorite movies. This would showcase my ability to interact with APIs, handle user input, and manage more complex state interactions.

- **Enhanced Responsive Design**: Further improve the responsiveness of the app, ensuring it looks and functions seamlessly across a wider range of devices and screen sizes.

## Feedback

I found this challenge to be engaging and comprehensive, covering a variety of concepts including API integration, state management, UI/UX design, and responsive web development. Adding a "like" functionality could enhance the complexity and showcase a broader skill set.
